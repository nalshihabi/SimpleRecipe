# SimpleRecipe
Quickly collect and simply display recipe information on the browser through a google chrome extension.

Many recipe websites are cluttered with irrelevant images, text, and ads. This chrome extension allows you to quickly get the ingredients and instructions and provides a small popup on the top right of the page with this information (It even works when the website has a popup that blocks you from viewing the content).

## Recipe Scrapping 
Most of the website scrapping code was taken from:
https://github.com/jadkins89/Recipe-Scraper
Unfortunetly there are some issues with chrome extensions that don't allow me to use that repo directly.

## How to contribute
1. The most useful contributions would be adding new website that can be processed. I do plan on making a smarted more general parser that will be able to parse a large number of sites but having dedicated parsers will always be prefered. 
2. Writing test
3. Documentation
4. Creating a better logo
